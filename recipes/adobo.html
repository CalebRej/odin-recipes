    <strong>
    <p>One of the most well-known Filipino cuisines is chicken adobo, an authentic Filipino dish. This meal, 
       which should not be confused with Mexican adobo, is cooked differently by simmering chicken in vinegar and soy sauce.</p>
    
    <p>According to a number of publications who specialise in the history of Asian cuisine, 
       the Filipinos were already making adobo prior to Spanish colonisation. They claim that adding vinegar during cooking protects the meat. 
       This technique is regarded as one of the earliest forms of food preservation.</p>
