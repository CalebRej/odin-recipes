    <strong>
    <p>This inihaw na pusit is wonderful when served fresh off the grill since it is packed with tomatoes and onions and marinated in a sweet and sour vinaigrette. 
       Ideal as a starter or main course.</p>
    
    <p>Grilled jumbo squid is an excellent choice for either an appetising starter or a filling dinner. 
       It's sure to satisfy because it's been grilled over hot coals to juicy perfection, packed with onions and tomatoes, 
       then marinated in a sweet and tangy vinaigrette.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 jumbo squid</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 onion, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>For the Marinade</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>0.5 cup honey</li>
        <li>0.5 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>0.5 cup vinegar</li>
        <li>5 to 6 gloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>1 thumb-sized ginger, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Holding the squid's tail tube with both hands, grab the cuttlebone—a thin, transparent piece of cartilage—with your fingers and pull away from the squid's body.</li>
        <li>Remove and discard the black ink. Cleanly drain and rinse the squid.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, consolidate honey, earthy colored sugar, vinegar, garlic, ginger, salt, and bean stew peppers. Mix together until sugar and salt are broken down.</li>
        <li>Delicately add squid in a solitary layer. Cover and marinate in the cooler for around 60 minutes. Channel squid quite well and completely wipe off. Hold marinade.</li>
        <li>In a pan, heat up the held marinade for around 7 to 10 minutes or until diminished.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine tomatoes and onions. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Divide tomato-onion mixture and stuff each of the squid.</li>
        <li>Grill squid over hot coals for about 4 to 5 minutes on each side, regularly basting with marinade. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
